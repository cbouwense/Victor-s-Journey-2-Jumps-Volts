--- 0.1.1 ---

+ Numpy's physics and sprites respond to changes in dimension.

--- 0.1.0 ---

+ Detection for if Numpy is on the floor, a wall, or a ceiling. Victor teleports accordingly (fixes bug where Victor teleported into floor).
+ Numpy's sprite changes depending on whether he is on the floor, on a wall, or on a ceiling.

/ Health bar now is always above Victor's head whether he is upside down or not.

- Got rid of the limited number of inversions per level.

--- 0.0.4 ---

+ Added sprites for Numpy
+ Fixed bugs with throwing Numpy.
+ Made Numpy only aim in the direction you are facing, whether left or right, upright or upside down.
+ Added camera views for bigger levels.
+ Implemented health bar over Victor. Depletes while Numpy is thrown.
+ Numpy can now be picked up after being thrown (you now pick him up when you teleport to him too).
+ Fixed bug where jumping into platforms from below would suck you into them and kill you.

/ Made gravity affect Numpy's flight.
/ Gave Numpy a faster initial velocity.

--- 0.0.3 ---

+ Implemented aiming, throwing, sticking, throwing, and returning Numpy.
+ Made inverting only possible once Numpy is thrown.

--- 0.0.2 ---

/ Tweaked the initial jump speed to 11.5 to jump a little higher.

--- 0.0.1 ---

+ Made "F" keybind for throwing Numpy and "G" for teleporting.

/ Revamped gravity so your acceleration is a function of your current speed (which entails a terminal velocity as well). 
/ Changed level swapping by putting all of the rooms in an array.

- Removed WASD controls.
