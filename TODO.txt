MECHANICS:

- You start off the levels with Numpy on your back
- When he is on your back you do not lose health but you cannot invert
- You can throw him off your back into a wall / ceiling in a fixed arc
- To regain Numpy, you can either collide with him or teleport to him
- Once Numpy is regained you replenish you HP bar
