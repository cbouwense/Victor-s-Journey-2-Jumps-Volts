--- Discuss scrolling vs. static levels.

-- 	Create first levels
-- 	Make new (or just updated) title screen.
-- 	Make new sprites for Victor.
-- 	Implement new gravity.
-- 	Decide on new sound effects / music?
-- 	Go through old code and optimize / make more readable.

- 	Figure out how to draw text in a non-retarded way.
- 	Get rid of extraneous shit from git repo (old folders).

MECHANICS:

- You start off the levels with Numpy on your back
- When he is on your back you do not lose health but you cannot invert
- You can throw him off your back into a wall / ceiling in a fixed arc
- To regain Numpy, you can either collide with him or teleport to him
- Once Numpy is regained you replenish you HP bar
